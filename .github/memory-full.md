Voice Conversation Setup (2025-12-15): Deployed OpenAI Realtime API for voice chat. Components: 1) realtime-proxy at /opt/gpt-app/realtime-proxy/server.js (port 9002), 2) gpt-realtime.service systemd unit, 3) voice-enabled frontend at /var/www/gpt/index.html, 4) backup at index-text-only.html. Architecture: Browser WebSocket to nginx:80/realtime to gpt-realtime:9002 to OpenAI Realtime API. Cost ~$0.06/min. Current limitation: voice mode has no access to memory/WooCommerce/Zoho tools - uses standalone OpenAI. Pending upgrade: Hybrid mode (Whisper STT + gpt-app backend + OpenAI TTS) for full tool access. Testing issue: WAN timeout, likely router port forwarding problem (port 80 to 192.168.80.2).
