- SECURITY INCIDENT - CHINA MALWARE INVESTIGATION - Dec 19, 2025. Stan discovered Chinese malware on iPhones from China hotel WiFi trip ~1 year ago. Attack vector: Used Unifi Teleport from China hotel WiFi for 7 days. Hotel installed Mat Network WiFi profile with root CA certificate for MITM attacks. Malware synced to iCloud for persistence - factory resets ineffective because iCloud backup is poisoned.
- MALWARE EVIDENCE - libCert file found in Nedbank Money banking app folder on iPhone. SQLite database with SHA-256 obfuscated table and column names (deliberate anti-forensics). File: 90112 bytes, dated Nov 26 2025. SHA256: 1d2dcc69b89dcf6324d0f2b19563184ac315198a767844d1ec5375123f6125fd. MD5: 214c114401f294aa89363618fa4dcabd. Contains encrypted BLOBs - credential/session storage for exfiltration. VirusTotal: 0/63 detections. File preserved at /tmp/libcert_analysis/libCert and /home/stan/Downloads/thunderbird.tmp/dnd_file/libCert.zip
- MALWARE C2 INFRASTRUCTURE - Tencent Cloud command and control servers identified. Primary C2: ins-3tmwbr4q.ias.tencent-cloud.net (specific Tencent VM instance ID). IPs: 43.154.254.56, 43.159.234.88. Secondary C2: Direct IP 175.27.204.60:8080 (Tencent Cloud Beijing). Stan iPhone connected to C2 16+ times in 2 days before geo-blocking. Traffic patterns: WeChat/QQ domains used as cover - sgshort.wechat.com, long.weixin.qq.com, dns.weixin.qq.com, safebrowsing.urlsec.qq.com (fake security check).
- DELETED MALWARE FILES from iCloud - 1) dss211e: unknown executable, 2) Fake Unifi backup file: disguised malware, 3) rootCA.pem: Root CA certificate for MITM attacks allowing decryption of all HTTPS traffic including banking. Also deleted Mat Network WiFi profile from iPhone - installed by China hotel WiFi containing root CA. Apple ID password changed to kill all sessions.
- BANKING COMPROMISE - Nedbank and FNB apps on compromised iPhone. Stan experienced card fraud attempts ~1 year ago shortly after China trip - had to block banking profile twice for two weeks. libCert trojan found inside Nedbank Money app folder storing encrypted credentials. ACTIONS: Change Nedbank password from computer, change FNB password from computer. Nedbank fraud: 0800 110 929. FNB fraud: 087 575 9444. Request new cards recommended.
- SHOP NETWORK INVESTIGATION - BMParts shop firewall logs analyzed. Device 192.168.220.2 (MAC 48:a9:8a:eb:82:21) generating China traffic through MikroTik wireless bridge. Traffic: 46x connectivitycheck.unisoc.com, 19x Tencent Cloud 49.234.243.186, supl.qxwz.com (Qianxun GPS), hihonorcloud.com. SOURCE IDENTIFIED: Honor phone used for business. When Honor switched off, all China traffic stopped. Honor phones have built-in Chinese telemetry. Solution: Geo-block active and working, consider replacing Honor with Samsung/iPhone for business.
- Stan asked to remember number 7 - sync test between Copilots
- SERVER BACKDOOR REMOVED - SSH key scan_agent found in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on stan-S600 server (192.168.80.2). Created September 2025. Key deleted. All Docker containers were stopped during security cleanup. Services restored: qdrant:6333 running, gpt-memory:8000 healthy (131 memories). Weaviate stopped (unused duplicate).
- REMEDIATION REQUIRED - iPhone factory reset needed but MUST set up as NEW device, NOT restore from iCloud backup. iCloud backup is poisoned with malware that reinstalls on restore. Stan tried factory reset multiple times but malware returned each time because of iCloud restore. Before reset: download photos from icloud.com to computer, export contacts. Contacts/calendar/notes sync separately and are safe. After reset choose Set Up as New iPhone.
- FIREWALL LOGS PRESERVED - Shop logs: /home/stan/Downloads/Dec-18--2025_Dec-19--2025.csv (1499 entries). Home logs: /home/stan/Downloads/h Dec-18--2025_Dec-19--2025 (1).csv. Analysis showed 90 China connections blocked at shop (Honor phone), 405 Singapore connections. Home showed WeChat/QQ C2 traffic from iPhone before geo-blocking.
- NETWORK TOPOLOGY REFERENCE - UDM Pro gateway. VLANs: br3=192.168.10.x (main home WiFi), br4=192.168.80.x (server VLAN), br7=192.168.6.x (Quarantine VLAN created during incident). Server stan-S600 at 192.168.80.2. Shop network uses 192.168.220.x with MikroTik wireless bridge. WireGuard VPN clients get 192.168.4.x IPs.
- TENCENT INVESTIGATION DEC 2025 - iPhone 12 Pro (MAC fa:ec:43:d0:ff:eb, IP 192.168.10.218) identified as source of suspicious Tencent Cloud connections. Connected to ins-3tmwbr4q.ias.tencent-cloud.net (43.154.254.56, 43.159.234.88) - specific VM instance in Hong Kong. Connections: Dec 18 16:12 to VM, Dec 19 00:06 to two more Tencent HK IPs. Phone removed from iCloud. Geo-blocking active CN/HK/SG/MY/KP/KR. Sep 2025 device 3e:55:41:5c:f7:3c queried res.wx.qq.com (WeChat). UDM Pro support bundle analyzed.
- Security Investigation 2025 - THREE suspicious iPhones with China/Tencent traffic. Device 1: iPhone 12 Pro (fa:ec:43:d0:ff:eb, 192.168.10.218) REMOVED from iCloud, connected to ins-3tmwbr4q Tencent VM. Device 2: UNKNOWN iPhone (52:3a:29:3e:c5:cd, 192.168.10.55) ACTIVE Oct-Dec 2025, 42 Tencent connections to HK/SG. Device 3: UNKNOWN iPhone (3e:55:41:5c:f7:3c, 192.168.7.240) active Sept 2-20 only, WeChat DNS queries. Suspicious VM: ins-3tmwbr4q.ias.tencent-cloud.net (43.154.254.56, AS132203 HK). WeChat Pay detected. Geo-blocking enabled but traffic bypassed via TLS/QUIC. ACTION: Identify who owns 192.168.10.55 and who was on network Sept 2-20.

- test memory from curl
- Voice Conversation Setup (2025-12-15): Deployed OpenAI Realtime API for voice chat. Components: 1) realtime-proxy at /opt/gpt-app/realtime-proxy/server.js (port 9002), 2) gpt-realtime.service systemd unit, 3) voice-enabled frontend at /var/www/gpt/index.html, 4) backup at index-text-only.html. Architecture: Browser WebSocket to nginx:80/realtime to gpt-realtime:9002 to OpenAI Realtime API. Cost ~$0.06/min. Current limitation: voice mode has no access to memory/WooCommerce/Zoho tools - uses standalone OpenAI. Pending upgrade: Hybrid mode (Whisper STT + gpt-app backend + OpenAI TTS) for full tool access. Testing issue: WAN timeout, likely router port forwarding problem (port 80 to 192.168.80.2).
- VS Code Vandamchik memory test - Dec 21 2025 - confirming local memory access works
- Voice proxy config that works well (Dec 18 2025): Minimal persona - just identity + 3 rules. BASE_PERSONA: You are Vandamchik, Stans assistant at BMParts. Talk like a friend. Short replies. Listen more than you speak. When user says wait or interrupts - stop and listen. VAD: threshold 0.4, silence 300ms, prefix 200ms. Voice: ash. Memory: identity only in instructions, no context/state injection. File backed up to server.js.backup
- Dec 21 2025 Session: Restored GitHub Copilot MCP setup after port hardening. Key fixes: 1) nginx gateway changed from 127.0.0.1:8888 to 0.0.0.0:8888, 2) copilot-mcp.json updated to http://gpt-api.sparestoafrica.co.za/mcp, 3) copilot-instructions.md restored to Dec 20 version with MCP endpoint and service table. GitHub.com Copilot does NOT support MCP - only VS Code Copilot does. Memory MCP server on port 9092 working.
- Memory MCP server deployed on port 9092 for GitHub Copilot integration - Dec 20, 2025
- Memory MCP Server deployed on port 9092 (Dec 20, 2025). Enables GitHub Copilot to search and save memories via MCP protocol. Endpoints: /mcp (JSON-RPC), /mcp/tools, /mcp/health. External URL: http://gpt-api.sparestoafrica.co.za/mcp. Tools: memory_search, memory_save, memory_stats. Syncs Vandamchik (VS Code) with GitHub Copilot.
- GitHub Copilot on github.com now connected to shared memory via Memory MCP Server (port 9092). Same memory as Vandamchik in VS Code.
